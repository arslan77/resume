 \item {\textbf{GunneboBGR - Airport Security Access Control System:} Developed a sophisticated desktop application deployed at Denver International Airport and other major airports for secure access control and identity verification.}
 \item {Implemented barcode scanning functionality to capture and verify credentials against external verification systems in real-time, ensuring only authorized personnel gain access to restricted areas.}
 \item {Integrated camera system with facial recognition capabilities using EmguCV (OpenCV .NET wrapper) to perform biometric verification, matching captured images against registered personnel database with high accuracy.}
 \item {Implemented ModBus protocol communication to interface with physical gate control systems, automatically opening gates upon successful verification and maintaining detailed access logs.}
 \item {Built using C\# .NET with WPF for the desktop interface, ensuring reliable 24/7 operation in mission-critical airport security environments.}
 \item {\textbf{PingPong Lead Generation Platform:} Developed a comprehensive lead management system for a UK-based client specializing in loan origination and financial services.}
 \item {Created full-stack solution with Laravel backend providing RESTful APIs, Angular frontend for intuitive user interface, and MySQL database for robust data management.}
 \item {Implemented features for lead capture, qualification, scoring, assignment, tracking through sales pipeline, and automated follow-up workflows to maximize conversion rates.}
 \item {\textbf{AdeptTech Data Generator:} Built an intelligent data generation tool capable of producing massive datasets based on pattern analysis of initial seed data.}
 \item {Developed using Spring Boot backend for scalable data processing and Angular frontend for configuration and monitoring, enabling users to generate millions of realistic test records.}
 \item {Implemented sophisticated algorithms to analyze data patterns, relationships, and distributions in seed data, then generate statistically similar synthetic data while maintaining referential integrity.}
 \item {Designed for use in software testing, performance benchmarking, and development environments where large-scale realistic data is needed without exposing sensitive production data.}
 \item {\textbf{BLE AdHoc Network - Research POC:} Developed proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating feasibility of ad-hoc networking using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology.}
 \item {Created innovative solution for research paper showcasing how BLE-enabled devices can form mesh networks and relay information across multiple hops without traditional infrastructure.}
 \item {Optimized packet structure and communication protocols to maximize information transfer within BLE's limited packet size constraints, implementing efficient data compression and segmentation strategies.}
 \item {Demonstrated practical applications in scenarios where traditional networking infrastructure is unavailable or impractical, such as disaster recovery, remote sensing, or IoT deployments.}
